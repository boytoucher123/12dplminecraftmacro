# Cubeland test harness

A way to run and check Cubeland on Linux without 12d Model.

12dPL is close enough to C++ that the macro can be turned into a C++ program
with a few mechanical changes. The harness does that, replaces each 12d
library call with a small stand-in, and drives the game from a script of
clicks and keys instead of a person. It is only a testing tool: the macro
never uses it, and nothing here goes into 12d.

## What it can tell you

- **The game logic works.** Scenarios break blocks, craft, kill a cow, cook
  beef, fall, die, respawn, and save and load worlds. `call dump` prints the
  player, inventory, cows, drops and furnaces so you can see the result.
- **What the screen looks like.** Every polygon the macro draws is filled
  into an image. `snap` saves the current frame to `run/out`.
- **Array mistakes.** It is compiled with AddressSanitizer and
  UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, so reading past the end of an array, or before
  index 1, stops the run with a report pointing at the line.
- **Record mistakes.** The `Attributes` stand-in copies by value (so code
  that only works if 12d shares Attributes as handles breaks here) and
  checks field types: a field written as an Integer and read as a Real is
  reported as a type error. Each run ends with the number of attribute
  calls and type errors; the type error count should be 0.
- **Some 12dPL pitfalls.** The translator warns about `+=`, `?:`, variables
  declared in `for` headers, joining two string literals, declaring
  the same variable twice in a function, and parameters or locals without
  their `p_` / `l_` prefix.

What it can't tell you: how fast the macro runs in 12d, how 12d's own panels
and widgets behave, or whether 12d accepts something that C++ accepts. The
stand-ins only copy the behaviour the macro relies on.

## How it works

1. `translate.py` runs the C preprocessor over `cubeland.4dm`, removes the
   `{ }` braces around global variables, adds 1 to every array size (12dPL
   arrays start at 1), renames `main` and writes `build/game.cpp`.
2. `runtime.h` defines the 12dPL types (`Integer`, `Real`, `Text`,
   `Attributes`, ...) and stand-ins for the library calls: maths, text,
   attributes, files, panels and widgets, the cursor and the clock.
3. `harness.cpp` holds the drawing calls, which fill polygons into a pixel
   buffer, and `Wait_on_events`, which plays back the scenario script. Each
   script step becomes the event 12d would send, and the clock moves on
   1/30 s per event.
4. `hooks.cpp` is appended to the translated game (after the macro's
   `#define`s, dumped with `cpp -dM`), so it can use the macro's records,
   functions and constants. That's where `call` commands such as `dump`,
   `give_beef` or `aim_cow` live.

## Using it

You need `g++`, `python3` and `cpp`. Pillow (`pip install pillow`) is only
needed to turn the snapshots into `.png` files.

```bash
./build.sh
```

```bash
./run.sh --all
```

```bash
./run.sh scenarios/02_crafting_and_tools.txt
```

Each run starts with no saved worlds. Pass `--keep` to keep them, which
scenario 06 needs because it loads the world that 05 saves. Worlds go in
`run/cubeland_worlds` and snapshots in `run/out`. Rebuild after changing the
macro.

## Scenario scripts

One command per line; `#` starts a comment.

| Command                | What it does                                                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `input <title>\|<text>` | type text into the input box with that title                   |
| `button <reply>`       | press a button (`create`, `play`, `delete`, `save`, `quit`)    |
| `select <n>`           | select the nth saved world in the menu                         |
| `click <x> <y>`        | left click the view at (x, y), from the bottom left            |
| `rclick`, `lbdown`, `move` | right click, mouse down, or mouse move at (x, y)           |
| `capclick`, `caprclick` | left or right click at the cursor while it's captured         |
| `look <dx> <dy>`       | move the mouse by (dx, dy) pixels                              |
| `wait <n>`             | let n frames pass                                              |
| `key <c> [n]`          | press a key (n times); `space` for the space bar               |
| `holdkey <c> <n>`      | hold a key for n frames (auto-repeat)                          |
| `time <s>`             | move the clock on by s seconds without a frame                 |
| `snap <name>`          | save the next frame as `run/out/<name>.ppm`/`.png`             |
| `call <hook>`          | run a hook from `hooks.cpp`                                    |
| `quit`                 | close the panel                                                |

When a script runs out, the panel is closed, so every scenario ends.

`snap` names the next frame that is drawn, which is the frame after the next
event, so put a `wait 1` (or another event) after it. `call` hooks that click
(`slot<n>`, `output`, `grid_*`) put their clicks at the front of the queue, so
they happen before the next script line.

Two environment variables help when something goes wrong:

```bash
TRACE=1 ./run.sh scenarios/02_crafting_and_tools.txt
```

```bash
TRACE_ATTR=1 ./run.sh scenarios/07_scenery.txt
```

`TRACE` prints every scripted event; `TRACE_ATTR` prints the record fields
that were looked up most often (to find hot spots).

## Scenarios

| Script                        | Checks                                                          |

| `06_load_fall_respawn`        | load the world from 05, fall damage, death and respawn          |
| `07_scenery`                  | biome and terrain statistics; the house, water, forest, desert, meadow, cave and hills |
| `08_crack_and_underwater`     | crack overlay on stone, the underwater view                     |
| `09_help_screen`              | the help panel                                                  |
| `10_settings`                 | the settings panel from the menu and in game, the - / = keys    |
| `11_save_and_load`            | items, tool wear, a furnace and block edits survive save and load |
| `12_delete_world`             | deleting a world empties and hides its file; the name can be reused |
| `13_resource_pack`            | a missing pack is reported; the test pack loads from its folder and from its zip (see below) |
| `14_iron_fly_pick`            | iron ore needs a stone pickaxe, iron recipes, pick block, hiding the HUD, frame statistics, flying |

### Resource pack test

`make_test_pack.py` writes a pack to `packs/` (ignored by git) that uses
every PNG colour type and bit depth the macro reads, all five row
filters, stored and compressed data, images bigger than 16 x 16, a tall
animation strip, colormaps, and a zip with stored and deflated entries and
a comment. Scenario 13 loads it and the `dump_textures` hook writes every
texture pixel to `run/out`; the script then compares them with the images:

```bash
python3 make_test_pack.py make
```

```bash
./run.sh scenarios/13_resource_pack.txt
```

```bash
python3 make_test_pack.py check run/out/textures.txt
```

`run/out/textures_folder.txt` holds the same check for the unzipped folder.
A real pack can be tried by copying it into `packs/` and changing the path
in the scenario.

Hooks use the macro's own constants (`ITEM_STONE_SWORD`, `BLOCK_STONE`, ...),
so they follow changes to `src/blocks.4dm`.
