| 0-based indexing                                                                 | 1-based indexing                                                                             |
| all programs start in `int main()`                                               | all programs start in `void main()`                                                          |
| No limiting syntax for global variables                                          | global variables must be declared inside curly braces<br>                                    |
| Pointers                                                                         | No pointers                                                                                  |
| Structs                                                                          | No structs                                                                                   |
| bool, int, double, etc                                                           | Completely different types -> 12dpl_data_types_documentation.json                            |
| printf, scanf                                                                    | Completely different functions -> 12dpl_functions_documentation.json                         |
| A variable declared in the `for`-init-statement is scoped to the `for` statement | A variable declared in the `for`-init-statement remains accessible after the `for` statement |
| Short circuit evaluation                                                         | No short-circuit evaluation, every condition is checked                                      |
| Pre-processor supports `'`, `"` in `#error`                                      | Just avoid it                                                                                |
| Concat strings with "part 1" "part 2"                                            | Concat text with "part one" + my_text_var + "part 2"                                         |
| `void` type is only for function `return`s                                       | It's not meant to, but `void` type compiles as a variable without issue                      |


## 12dPL Features

| Feature                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `switch` supports `Integer64`/`Integer`/`Text`/`Real` types |
| `Text` supports `==` for string comparison                  |
| 'c' is an `Integer`, "c" is `Text`                          |

## 12dPL GUI

| Details                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All GUI elements are derived from `Widget`s                                                                                |
| You can cast a GUI element to a `Widget` like so:<br>`Widget cast_to_widget(Widget widget) {`<br>  `return widget;`<br>`}` |
| widgets can be appended in any order                                                                                       |
| must finish appending before calling `Show_widget(Panel)`                                                                  |
| Set_data(...) should be called after `Show_widget(Panel)`                                                                  |
| `Show_widget(Panel)` is how the panel is brought to the display                                                            |
| Any special `Set_visible(...)` logic must be called each time the panel is shown                                           |

## 12d Environment

| Feature                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| There are none-to-many views                                                         |
| Text is not supported in Perspective view                                            |
| Project has tins and models                                                          |
| Models can have elements and tins                                                    |
| Elements is a broad category, mainly concerned with super strings                    |
| Super strings have vertexes                                                          |
| Models and tins can be displayed on views                                            |
| Tins can exist without models, suboptimal                                            |
| There is an output window, it is a `Log_Box` and is where `Print(...)` statements go |
