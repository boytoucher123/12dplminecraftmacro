// Safety
//
// Blocks every 12dPL library call that could harm the computer, the
// 12d project or the user's files. Each blocked call is replaced by
// "illegal_call", which isn't defined anywhere, so a macro that uses
// one doesn't compile. That proves what the macro can't do without
// anyone reading the rest of the source:
//
//   - start programs, run shell commands or other macros and chains
//   - delete, copy, rename or overwrite files outside the output
//     folder, or delete folders
//   - delete or change models, tins, elements, views, functions or
//     project settings, or save the project
//   - use the clipboard, databases or network services (Synergy,
//     ODBC, web links)
//
// Files: File_open is blocked too. The only way to open a file is
// safe_file_open() below, which opens any file for reading but only
// opens files inside SAFE_WRITE_FOLDER for writing.
//
// build.4dm includes this file before anything else, so the blocks
// cover every source file. Don't include anything before it, and
// never #undef one of these names. It depends on no other header.
//
// A macro whose job really is one of these things (deleting a model,
// writing a 12da file, ...) removes only that one line and leaves a
// comment in its place saying what is allowed and why, so a reader
// still sees exactly what the macro may do.
